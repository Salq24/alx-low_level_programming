/**
* main: Write a program that prints all possible different
* combinations of two digits.
*
* description:
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
* The two digits must be different
* 01 and 10 are considered the same combination
* Print only the smallest combination of two digits
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function
* (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
* You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
* You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
* All your code should be in the main function
* This project requires us to print all
* single digit numbers, i.e , numbers less than 10,
* including zero. This can be done using for and while
* loops. You can also use printf or putchar to carry
* it out. ASCII coding is required when you are using
* putchar because an interger is used in this case.
*The ASCII coding starts from 048 (which is 0). Then
* 049 (1) and on and on. Also includes alphabets.
*
*return : This is always 0 which means success
